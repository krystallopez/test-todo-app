1. Sequelize: Sequelize is an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library for Node.js that provides an easy-to-use interface for communicating with relational databases such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MSSQL. Sequelize enables you to interact with databases using JavaScript instead of writing SQL queries directly.

2. Querying and Transactions: Sequelize provides a simple and flexible interface for querying databases, including support for transactions and advanced query functionality.

3. Hooks and Validations: Sequelize allows you to define hooks and validations that can be triggered before or after certain actions on your data models, such as saving or updating a record.

4.Associations: Sequelize provides powerful support for creating associations between models, including one-to-one, one-to-many, and many-to-many relationships.

5. Promise: In Sequelize, a promise is an object that represents the eventual completion or failure of an asynchronous operation. Promises are commonly used in Node.js to handle asynchronous operations, such as reading from a database or making an HTTP request. In Sequelize, many methods return a promise, which you can use to handle the result of the operation. For example, you can use the then method of the promise to specify a callback function to be called when the promise is resolved, or the catch method to handle any errors that might have occurred.
